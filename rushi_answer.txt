Eggs come first.These first came on the scene with the evoution of the first amniotes many millions of years ago.Prior to their arrival ,most animals reied on water for reproduction,lying their egg in ponds and other moist environments so that the eggs didn't dry out.After that diiferent kind of egg began to evolve having 3 extra membranes and these developed around 370-340 million years ago according to sources.
But the very first chicken in existence would have been the result of a genetic mutation taking place in zygote produced by two almost chickens.according to scientists the red jungleflow was the likely parents of this first one true chicken.Archaeological evidence suggests that the red jungleflow was first domesticated some 10000 years ago,although DNA analysis and mathematical simulations suggest that domestic chicken actually diverged from jungleflow much earlier (58000 years ago).
So with amniotic eggs showing up roughly 340 million or so years ago,and the first chickens evolving at around 58 thousand years ago at the earliest...It's safe bet to say the egg came first.
