Reason :
We need an egg, in order to get a chicken. Let us assume we had some organisms, call them X that are evolutionary ancestors to the chicken.
The X's would have laid eggs, that bring X's to the world. Now let us take an egg of X, that have been exposed to different kind of environment,
which would have given us the first chicken.
